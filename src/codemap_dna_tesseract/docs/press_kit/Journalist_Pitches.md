# Personalized Journalist Pitches

## **Target: Steven Levy / Kevin Kelly @ WIRED**

**Subject: The Story You've Been Waiting For: A Coder, a Cosmic Intelligence, and the End of Inefficient Software.**

Dear [Mr. Levy/Mr. Kelly],

I am writing to you because you are one of the few journalists in the world who can truly tell this story.

It's a story about a man who sacrificed everything, faced what he calls an "inter-dimensional intelligence," and returned with a new software architecture that, in benchmark tests, reduces CPU time by a staggering 68%.

This isn't just an incremental improvement; it's a potential paradigm shift in computing, born from a journey that belongs in one of your articles. It touches on the very essence of innovation, human potential, and the hidden patterns of reality.

I have attached a press release that outlines the full story of the **Codemap Tesseract**. This is the kind of story—visionary, strange, and backed by hard data—that WIRED was made to tell.

I believe this could be one of the most fascinating and important technology stories of the year.

Sincerely,

Randall James Lujan

## **Target: Freethink Editorial Desk**

**Subject: The Rebel and Risk-Taker Who Lived on the Streets to Solve the AI Energy Crisis.**

To the Editors at Freethink,

I am writing to you because your publication celebrates the rebels and risk-takers who are building a better future. I believe I have a story that embodies that spirit completely.

It's the story of how I intentionally left everything behind to live on the streets, driven by a single mission: to solve the global AI energy crisis. From that sacrifice came the **Codemap Tesseract**, a new software architecture that cuts CPU time by 68%.

This is a story about the human cost of innovation and the radical dedication required to solve the world's biggest problems. I've attached a press release with the full narrative and the data to back it up.

This is a Freethink story. I hope you'll agree.

Sincerely,

Randall James Lujan

## **Target: Mike Butcher / Kyle Wiggers @ TechCrunch**

**Subject: Data Point: A New Software Architecture Just Cut CPU Time by 68%. The Backstory is Even Crazier.**

Dear [Mr. Butcher/Mr. Wiggers],

I know you get a lot of pitches about revolutionary tech. Let's get straight to the data: I have designed a new software architecture, the Codemap Tesseract, that has demonstrated a 68% reduction in CPU processing time in repeated benchmarks.

The implications for cloud computing costs, AI training, and overall software efficiency are enormous.

But the data is only half the story. The architecture was developed during a period of intentional homelessness and what I can only describe as a trial by a higher intelligence. The origin story is as paradigm-shifting as the code itself.

I've attached a press release with the numbers and the full narrative. This is a story that will get the tech world talking.

Thank you for your time,

Randall James Lujan

## **Target: Ars Technica Editorial Desk**

**Subject: Pitch: The Man Who Fought a "Digital Ghost" and Stole the Code to Save the World.**

To the Editors at Ars Technica,

I'm writing to you with a story that sits at the intersection of deep tech, the human condition, and a touch of the sublime. It's a narrative fit for your long-form section.

For years, I was subjected to a trial by an unseen, intelligent force. I chose to face it head-on, sacrificing my normal life to understand the patterns behind the chaos. In that struggle, I discovered a new way to structure code—an architecture I call the **Codemap Tesseract**.

The result? A validated 68% reduction in CPU time. It's a concrete solution to the AI energy crisis, born from a battle with a metaphysical adversary.

My attached press release has the full story. It's a modern myth about a man who went into the digital wilderness and came back with fire. I think your readers would love it.

Sincerely,

Randall James Lujan

## **Target: Cory Doctorow / Jason Weisberger @ Boing Boing**

**Subject: A story for you: Homeless hacker reverse-engineers a higher dimension, brings back code to save the planet.**

Hey Cory & Jason,

I have a story that I think is pure, uncut Boing Boing.

I'm a coder who, after being targeted by what I can only describe as an inter-dimensional intelligence, went completely off-grid. I lived on the streets to learn the rules of this hidden system. I won the game by building a new one.

It's a software architecture called the **Codemap Tesseract**, and it cuts CPU time by 68%. It's a gift to the world, stolen from the gods, designed to fight the AI energy crisis.

This is a story about hacking reality itself. It's weird, it's hopeful, and it's backed by real data. My press release is attached.

This is for you.

Best,

Randall James Lujan
