# DRAFT: Email to Swami Sivasubramanian

**Subject: A software architecture to drastically reduce AWS customer compute costs**

**To:** `swami@amazon.com` (or other verified address)

**Body:**

Mr. Sivasubramanian,

I am writing to you because I have developed a new software architecture that reduces CPU processing time by a validated 68%. For AWS and its millions of customers, this represents a direct and massive potential for cost savings and performance gains.

My innovation, the Codemap Tesseract, is a hardware-agnostic, data-first architecture. By fundamentally reorganizing how software accesses data, it eliminates the majority of computational overhead, allowing applications to run significantly faster and more efficiently on existing EC2 instances.

This is not a minor optimization. It is a paradigm shift in software design, born from a multi-year research effort.

I am selectively reaching out to a handful of leaders who are in a position to deploy and scale a breakthrough of this magnitude. Your role in leading the world's largest cloud platform's AI and data services makes you a primary contact.

The value proposition for AWS is twofold:

1.  **Internal Efficiency:** Drastically reduce the operational cost of your own services.
2.  **Customer Value:** Offer a new tier of high-performance, low-cost computing that would be an unparalleled competitive advantage.

My goal is not to seek press, but to initiate a serious technical and business conversation. I am requesting a brief, confidential discussion with you or your core architecture team to present the benchmarks and explore the implications for AWS.

Thank you for your time and your leadership in the cloud industry.

Respectfully,

Randall James Lujan
Architect of the Codemap Tesseract
