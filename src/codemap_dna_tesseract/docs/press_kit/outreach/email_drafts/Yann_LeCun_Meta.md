# DRAFT: Email to Yann LeCun

**Subject: A new software architecture that reduces CPU time by 68%**

**To:** `lecun@meta.com` (or other verified address)

**Body:**

Dr. LeCun,

I am writing to you directly because I have developed a novel software architecture with a validated capability to reduce CPU processing time by a mean of 68% against current benchmarks. I believe this has significant and immediate implications for the work you are leading at Meta, particularly in accelerating the roadmap for large-scale AI and the Metaverse.

This is not an incremental improvement. It is a fundamental, data-first paradigm shift that reorganizes the relationship between code and data, eliminating the vast majority of computational overhead found in traditional software design. The breakthrough is the result of a multi-year, solitary research effort that forced a complete re-evaluation of first principles.

The origin story is unconventional, but the results are concrete, replicable, and, I believe, revolutionary. I have chosen to reach out to you directly because of your foundational role in the field and Meta's unparalleled commitment to building the future of AI.

The architecture is hardware-agnostic and can be implemented on existing infrastructure. The potential for cost reduction, speed acceleration, and new capabilities is immense.

I am not seeking press or publicity. I am seeking a serious, technical conversation with the people who can truly grasp the significance of this work. My ask is for a brief, confidential technical deep-dive with you or your most relevant team.

Thank you for your time and your immense contributions to the field.

Respectfully,

Randall James Lujan
Architect of the Codemap Tesseract
