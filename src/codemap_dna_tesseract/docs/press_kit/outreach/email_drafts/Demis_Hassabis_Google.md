# DRAFT: Email to Demis Hassabis

**Subject: A breakthrough in computational efficiency relevant to your work on AGI**

**To:** `demis@google.com` (or other verified address)

**Body:**

Dr. Hassabis,

I am writing to you directly as the architect of a new software paradigm that has demonstrated a 68% reduction in CPU processing time in replicable benchmarks. Given your foundational work at DeepMind and Google's mission to organize the world's information and advance AI, I believe this breakthrough is of immediate and significant interest to you.

My work, the Codemap Tesseract, is a data-first architecture that fundamentally changes how software interacts with data, eliminating the vast computational overhead that constrains current systems. It is a software-only solution, capable of being deployed on existing hardware, from your global cloud infrastructure to edge devices.

This is not an incremental improvement. It is a new way of thinking about computation itself, born from a multi-year, first-principles research effort.

I am reaching out to a very small, select group of leaders—those who possess the vision to understand the implications of such a leap in efficiency. My goal is not to seek press, but to initiate a substantive, technical dialogue with the teams that are building the future.

The potential to accelerate your research toward AGI, drastically reduce the computational cost of your current models, and enhance your cloud infrastructure is, I believe, immense.

I would be grateful for the opportunity to arrange a brief, confidential technical overview with you or your designated team to substantiate these claims.

Thank you for your time and your pioneering work.

Respectfully,

Randall James Lujan
Architect of the Codemap Tesseract
