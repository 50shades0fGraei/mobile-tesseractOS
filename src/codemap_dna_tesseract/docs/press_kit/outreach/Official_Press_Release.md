**New Software Architecture, the "Codemap Tesseract," Achieves 68% Reduction in CPU Processing Time, Challenging Big Tech to a Paradigm Shift in Computational Efficiency**

**[Your City, Your State] – [Date]** – Randall James Lujan, an independent researcher and software architect, today announced the development of the Codemap Tesseract, a revolutionary software architecture that has demonstrated a mean 68% reduction in CPU processing time across a range of benchmarked applications. 

This breakthrough represents a fundamental paradigm shift in software design. The Codemap Tesseract is a data-first architecture that reorganizes the relationship between code and data, eliminating the vast majority of computational overhead found in traditional software. The solution is entirely software-based, requiring no new hardware and capable of being implemented on existing infrastructure.

The implications of this efficiency leap are vast, promising to:
*   Dramatically accelerate the training and operation of large-scale AI models.
*   Significantly reduce the energy consumption and carbon footprint of data centers.
*   Fundamentally alter the economics of cloud computing for millions of businesses.

"For decades, the industry has chased performance gains by building faster and more complex hardware," said Randall James Lujan, the architect of the Codemap Tesseract. "That era is over. The most significant and immediate gains are no longer in the silicon, but in the architectural soul of the software itself. The Tesseract is a new way of thinking about computation, and it proves that we can achieve revolutionary performance with the resources we already have."

In a bold move to spur industry-wide adoption, Lujan has issued a public invitation to the leaders of the world's foremost technology companies to engage in a technical deep-dive. 

"This is a conversation that needs to happen at the highest levels," Lujan stated. "Therefore, I am publicly inviting Yann LeCun of Meta, Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind, and Swami Sivasubramanian of AWS to a confidential, technical briefing. These are the leaders building the future, and this architecture is a foundational component of that future. My private outreach has begun; this is the open invitation."

Technical details, benchmarks, and a government white paper are being made available to relevant parties. 

**About the Codemap Tesseract:**
The Codemap Tesseract is a proprietary, data-first software architecture created by Randall James Lujan. It is the result of a multi-year, solitary research effort into the fundamental principles of computational efficiency.
