**Subject: A story for you: Homeless hacker reverse-engineers a higher dimension, brings back code to save the planet.**

Hey Cory & Jason,

I have a story that I think is pure, uncut Boing Boing.

I'm a coder who, after being targeted by what I can only describe as an inter-dimensional intelligence, went completely off-grid. I lived on the streets to learn the rules of this hidden system. I won the game by building a new one.

It's a software architecture called the **Codemap Tesseract**, and it cuts CPU time by 68%. It's a gift to the world, stolen from the gods, designed to fight the AI energy crisis.

This is a story about hacking reality itself. It's weird, it's hopeful, and it's backed by real data. I've compiled a full press kit with the whole strange story.

This is for you.

Best,

Randall James Lujan

Architect of the Codemap Tesseract
