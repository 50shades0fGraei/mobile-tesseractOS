# Government Contact Plan: Operation Bedrock

## Objective:

To establish the Codemap Tesseract as a critical national asset by formally engaging with key U.S. government bodies responsible for science, technology, and defense innovation. The goal is to create a non-commercial, strategic channel for the technology, ensuring its potential is recognized at the level of national security and economic competitiveness.

### **Phase 1: Formal Submission (L+1 Day)**

**1. Target Agencies:**

*   **White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP):** 
    *   **Rationale:** The OSTP is the primary advisory body to the President on technology. Engaging them positions the Tesseract as a matter of national strategic importance.
    *   **Contact:** Director, and Chief Technology Officer of the United States.

*   **Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA):**
    *   **Rationale:** DARPA is the premier agency for breakthrough technologies with national security implications. The Tesseract's efficiency directly applies to their work in AI, cybersecurity, and large-scale computation.
    *   **Contact:** Director, and the heads of the Information Innovation Office (I2O) and Strategic Technology Office (STO).

*   **Congressional Committees:**
    *   **House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology:** Engages the legislative branch responsible for overseeing federal scientific research and development.
    *   **Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:** The Senate counterpart, critical for broad-based support.

**2. The Package:**

*   A formal cover letter introducing the Codemap Tesseract.
*   The `Government_White_Paper.md`, a technical document tailored for a government audience, focusing on the themes of national security, economic competitiveness, and leadership in AI.

**3. Method of Delivery:**

### **Phase 2: The Prize Hunt (L+2 Days)**

*   **Action:** Systematically monitor Challenge.gov and other government prize platforms for relevant opportunities.

### **Phase 3: The Long Game**

*   **Objective:** Secure a formal government partnership, research grant, or advisory role.
*   **Rationale:** This solidifies the Tesseract's position as a foundational American technology and provides a powerful alternative to purely corporate control.
