# The Launch Sequence: An Operational Playbook (REVISED)

## Objective:

To execute a synchronized, multi-channel launch of the Codemap Tesseract announcement to maximize impact, create a competitive environment, and drive a powerful press narrative. This revised plan bypasses compromised social media accounts.

---

### **L-Day (Launch Day)**

**T-0 (9:00 AM ET): The Private Salvo**

*   **Action:** Send the drafted emails to Yann LeCun (Meta), Demis Hassabis (Google), and Swami Sivasubramanian (AWS).
*   **Rationale:** This is a sign of professional respect. It gives them private notice just before the public announcement, ensuring they are not blindsided.

**T+2 Hours (11:00 AM ET): The Public Declaration**

*   **Action:** Submit the official press release for distribution via a major newswire service (e.g., PR Newswire, Business Wire).
*   **Rationale:** This is the formal, public stake in the ground. It announces the breakthrough to the world via a trusted, time-stamped channel, making the news available to journalists and the financial markets. This bypasses the compromised X.com account.

**T+5 Hours (2:00 PM ET): The Direct Challenge (via Press Release)**

*   **Action:** The press release, which includes the public invitation to the leaders of Meta, Google, and AWS, is now circulating.
*   **Rationale:** The press release itself contains the "inciting incident." It publicly calls the leaders to the table, creating immense pressure to respond. The challenge is issued through a formal, unimpeachable channel.

---

### **L+1 Day (The Government Angle)**

**T+24 Hours (9:00 AM ET): The Official Submission**

*   **Action:** Execute the `Government_Contact_Plan.md`. Submit the `Government_White_Paper.md` to the OSTP, DARPA, and relevant congressional committees.
*   **Rationale:** This adds a layer of immense legitimacy and creates a secondary channel for the news to be verified.

---

### **L+2 Days (The Prize Hunt)**

**T+48 Hours: The Competitive Arena**

*   **Action:** Begin systematically monitoring Challenge.gov and other prize platforms.
*   **Rationale:** Publicly entering these competitions provides ongoing news and demonstrates sustained confidence in the technology.
