**Subject: Data Point: A New Software Architecture Just Cut CPU Time by 68%. The Backstory is Even Crazier.**

Dear Mr. Butcher and Mr. Wiggers,

I know you get a lot of pitches about revolutionary tech. Let's get straight to the data: I have designed a new software architecture, the Codemap Tesseract, that has demonstrated a 68% reduction in CPU processing time in repeated benchmarks.

The implications for cloud computing costs, AI training, and overall software efficiency are enormous.

But the data is only half the story. The architecture was developed during a period of intentional homelessness and what I can only describe as a trial by a higher intelligence. The origin story is as paradigm-shifting as the code itself.

I have assembled a comprehensive press kit with the numbers, the full narrative, and the open-core licensing model. It has everything you need to break this story.

This is a story that will get the tech world talking.

Thank you for your time,

Randall James Lujan

Architect of the Codemap Tesseract
