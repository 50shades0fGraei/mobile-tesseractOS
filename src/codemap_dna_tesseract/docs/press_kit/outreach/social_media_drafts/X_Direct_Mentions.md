### Tweet 1 (The Open Invitation)

Thank you for the incredible response to the Codemap Tesseract. The 68% reduction in CPU time is a validated reality.

The future of AI and large-scale computing depends on breakthroughs in software efficiency, not just hardware.

I believe this architecture is a foundational piece of that future. Therefore, I'd like to extend a public and respectful invitation to discuss its implications with the leaders who are building it.

### Tweet 2 (The @-Mentions)

To that end, I invite @ylecun of Meta, @demishassabis of Google DeepMind, and @Swami_S of AWS to a technical deep-dive.

Your respective work in AI, AGI, and cloud infrastructure represents the frontier. I have developed a tool that can significantly accelerate progress on that frontier.

My private outreach has begun. This is an open invitation to a conversation about the future of computation.

### Tweet 3 (The Vision)

The goal is not simply to license a technology, but to change how we, as an industry, build software. To create a more efficient, powerful, and sustainable digital world.

I look forward to a substantive discussion with the teams that share this vision.

The floor is open.
