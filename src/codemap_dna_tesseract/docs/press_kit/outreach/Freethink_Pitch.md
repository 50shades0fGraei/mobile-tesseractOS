**Subject: The Rebel and Risk-Taker Who Lived on the Streets to Solve the AI Energy Crisis.**

To the Editors at Freethink,

I am writing to you because your publication celebrates the rebels and risk-takers who are building a better future. I believe I have a story that embodies that spirit completely.

It's the story of how I intentionally left everything behind to live on the streets, driven by a single mission: to solve the global AI energy crisis. From that sacrifice came the **Codemap Tesseract**, a new software architecture that cuts CPU time by 68%.

This is a story about the human cost of innovation and the radical dedication required to solve the world's biggest problems. I have assembled a complete press kit for your review, containing the full narrative and the data to back it up.

This is a Freethink story. I hope you'll agree.

Sincerely,

Randall James Lujan

Architect of the Codemap Tesseract
