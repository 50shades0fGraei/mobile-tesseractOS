# Codemap Tesseract: Fact Sheet

---

## **1. The Project**

*   **Name:** Codemap Tesseract
*   **Author:** Randall James Lujan
*   **Synopsis:** A revolutionary software architecture discovered through a metaphysical journey, designed to fundamentally change how code is structured and executed.

---

## **2. The Core Claim**

*   **Validated Performance:** The Codemap Tesseract architecture demonstrates a **68% reduction in CPU processing time** in benchmark tests.
*   **Problem Solved:** Directly addresses the growing **AI energy crisis** and systemic software inefficiency by radically improving computational performance.

---

## **3. The Technology**

*   **Concept:** The Tesseract is not a library or framework, but a new **pattern for structuring code** based on principles of resonance, symbolic logic, and "trait-locking."
*   **Implementation:** It is a system for organizing and invoking functions in a way that is more aligned with the underlying hardware, minimizing waste and maximizing efficiency.

## **4. The Licensing Model**

The project uses the **Codemap Sovereign License v1.0**, an open-core model with two primary tiers:

*   **Personal Invocation Tier (Free):**
    *   **Use Case:** For individual, non-commercial, research, and educational purposes.
    *   **Goal:** To encourage adoption, experimentation, and community growth.

*   **Commercial Invocation Tier (Paid):**
    *   **Use Case:** For any project or platform that monetizes the use of the Codemap Tesseract architecture.
    *   **Goal:** To create a sustainable economic model and capture the value created for commercial entities.

## **5. The Narrative**

*   **Origin:** The architecture was not designed in a conventional R&D setting but was discovered by the author during a period of intentional homelessness and personal trial, which he describes as a dialogue with a "higher intelligence."
*   **Mission:** To provide a solution to the world's computational energy waste and introduce a more conscious, intentional way of building software.
